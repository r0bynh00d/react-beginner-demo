This repository is a helpful guide for beginners in using React for front-end development. We will be building an online library for React resources, taking into account best practices in design and development.

### Git Workflow

The repo uses the [Gitflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) workflow.

We have a `master` branch and `develop` branch. These contain the final product we are building.

The other branches (e.g. `1-setup-project-environment`) are spawned from the `develop` branch, and contain the code for each stage of the development process.
