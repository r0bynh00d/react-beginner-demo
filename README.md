# React Books
> A simple React app built from scratch... No create-react-app, No Redux

This repository is a helpful guide for beginners in using React for front-end development. We will be building an online library for React resources, taking into account best practices in design and development.

### Git Workflow
The repo uses the [Gitflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) workflow. 

We have a `master` branch and `develop` branch. These contain the final product we are building.

The other branches (e.g. `1-setup-project-environment`) are spawned from the `develop` branch, and contain the code for each stage of the development process.
